### 1. **Defining the Workspace Structure**

Each workspace, including the default, will have a data model that likely includes the following properties:

- **Name**: The workspace's name.
- **Path**: The physical storage path for the workspace.
- **IsActive**: A Boolean indicating if the workspace is currently active.
- **IsDefault**: A Boolean indicating if the workspace is the default workspace.

### 2. **Creating the Workspace Data Model**

In Swift, you can define the workspace model as follows:

```swift
struct Workspace: Identifiable, Codable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var path: URL
    var isActive: Bool = false
    var isDefault: Bool = false
}
```

### 3. **Workspace Management**

Workspace management will be a key part of the app, with the ability to:

- **Create a new workspace**: Duplicate the home directory's main folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.) in the new workspace's path.
- **Delete a workspace**: Only allowed for non-default workspaces.
- **Switch between workspaces**: Update the symbolic links in the home directory to point to the new workspace's folders.
- **Preserve the default workspace**: The default workspace is a special case and cannot be deleted or moved.

### 4. **Modifying Symbolic Links for Workspace Change**

When switching workspaces, the app must update the symbolic links for the main folders. This will require executing system commands in Swift. Here's a way to approach it:

```swift
import Foundation

func updateSymbolicLinks(for workspace: Workspace) {
    let fileManager = FileManager.default
    let folders = ["Desktop", "Documents", "Downloads", "Music", "Pictures", "Videos"]

    folders.forEach { folder in
        let originalPath = fileManager.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser.appendingPathComponent(folder).path
        let newPath = workspace.path.appendingPathComponent(folder).path

        // Remove existing symbolic link or folder
        try? fileManager.removeItem(atPath: originalPath)

        // Create new symbolic link
        try? fileManager.createSymbolicLink(atPath: originalPath, withDestinationPath: newPath)
    }
}
```

### 5. **SwiftUI App Structure**

The SwiftUI application will have a simple, navigable UI that allows the user to:

- **View all workspaces**: A list view that shows all the workspaces.
- **Workspace detail**: A detailed editor for the workspace's settings.
- **Create new workspace**: A form to create a new workspace.

### 6. **Main App Flow in SwiftUI**

The `ContentView` of the app might have a `NavigationView` that includes:

- **A list of workspaces**: Each row in the list could have a workspace name and a "Make Active" button.
- **A special default workspace**: Marked and unremovable.
- **Functionality to add workspaces**: A button to create new workspaces.

### 7. **Handling the Default Workspace**

Ensure the default workspace is generated at the first launch of the app, and it's the one that mirrors the real, current structure of the user's home directory. When the app is first launched, it should:

- **Designate the default workspace**: Mark the initial, real home directory setup as the "Default Workspace."
- **Prevent the deletion or renaming of the default workspace**: Logic in the workspace list and detail views should disable such options for the default workspace.

### 8. **Practical Security Notice**

Modifying the main home directory folders to be symbolic links to other directories can have a significant security and data loss impact. This functionality should be thoroughly tested in a controlled environment, and the end-user should be made aware of the data and security implications.

### 9. **macOS Permissions**

Given the system-level manipulations, the application will need to request and be granted appropriate security and accessibility permissions to access and modify the user's home directory and create symbolic links.

### 10. **Preserving the App's Role**

The app should be clear in its primary function: to manage and switch between different, self-contained workspaces. It should not, by default, alter the main, non-workspace-related data and system settings of the macOS user profile.

### Development Roadmap

1. **Prototype**: Start with a simple, non-destructive proof of concept to switch between workspaces.
2. **Incremental Rollout**: Gradually add the other features, like the ability to manage the main home folder's default links, ensuring that the app's main data-altering functions are well-tested.
3. **Comprehensive Security and Data Handling Strategy**: Before the first user test, ensure that the system has fail-safes, data recovery, and a full range of macOS security and access system handling.
